### Run

nearby_shops requires  [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to run.
Install the dependencies and start the server For production environments....

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/reyx7/nearby_shops.git
$ cd nearby_shops
#Install Paquages and Virtuallan managaer
$ pip3 install pipenv
# install Dependencies for production
$ pipenv install --pre
# Start the server in Port 8000
$ pipenv run gunicorn  -b "0.0.0.0:8000" backend.config.wsgi
```
If you need more workers, add --workers=n options to gunicorn
```
$ pipenv run gunicorn  -b "0.0.0.0:8000" --workers=3 backend.config.wsgi
```

Verify the server in your preferred browser.

```sh
http://localhost:8000
```


### Run in docker
nearby_shops is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/reyx7/nearby_shops.git
cd nearby_shops
docker build -t nearby_shops .
```
This will create the nearby_shops image and pull in the necessary dependencies.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 7000 of the host to port 8000 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 7000:8000 --restart="always" nearby_shops
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
http://localhost:7000
```


#### Building from source
Build from source requires [node v4+](http://nodejs.org) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/).
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/reyx7/nearby_shops.git
$ cd nearby_shops
# Install paquages for front and back
$ yarn install
$ pip3 install pipenv
$ pipenv install --pre
# make migration & collect static file of forntend to django
$ pipenv ./manage.py migrate
$ pipenv ./manage.py collectstatic
# run server
$ pipenv run gunicorn  -b "0.0.0.0:8000" backend.config.wsgi
```
Check the application in your favorite browser:
```sh
    http://localhost:8000/
```
